## The VBA of Wall Street

### Task:
Write a VBA script to analyse real stock market data. 

### Output:
A [script](https://github.com/catherinesloan/VBA-challenge/blob/main/VBA-script) that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs: 
1. The ticker symbol
2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
3. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
4. The total stock volume of the stock
5. Conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red
6. Returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"

***A for loop that allows code to run on every worksheet, i.e. every year***
